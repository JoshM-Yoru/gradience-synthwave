Synthwave preset for Gradience 

<h2>Setup</h2>
You will need to place preset in your Gradience preset folder.
<p></p>

`  git clone https://github.com/JoshM-Yoru/gradience-synthwave    `

`  cd gradience-synthwave/presets    `

`  mv synthwave.json ~/.var/app/com.github.GradienceTeam.Gradience/config/presets    `

Open Gradience and then select preset 

<h2>Optionally</h2>
As of right now the volume sliders and some selector overlays don't seem to be taking to the theming, for me at least, so I have added my gnome-shell theme as well to make those adjustments. These will need to go into your `.themes/` folder and you can use `gnome-tweaks` to select it as your shell theme. 
<p></p>
Navigate to the `gradience-synthwave` folder
<p></p>

`  cd ~/gradience-synthwave    `

`  mv synthwave ~/.themes/    `

Go into `gnome-tweaks` and in the Apperance tab select `synthwave` for the Shell.
